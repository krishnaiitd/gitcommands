    <h2> Git remote (<code> git remote </code>) Command</h2>
  </p>

<div>

<h3> This command usefull while you are working with multiple upstream i.e in case of fork and you want to do some changes in multiple person fork repository<h3>
	<p>You and your colleagues [e.g: allice, bob etc] working on a repository called project1, and bob has created a branch bug-1 in  their fork report of project1 and changes have been completed in branch bug-1, just in case you want to change in bob branch bug-1, then you have to do the following steps before you can checkout bob branch bug-1.
	</p>
	<p> 1. You have already have to upstream i.e on for main repository i.e project1 and one for your fork reporsitory of project1, so the following command looks like:
		<br>
	<code>$ git remote -v </code>
	<br>
	<code>
	origin	https://github.com/krishnaiitd/swirl_courses.git (fetch)
	origin	https://github.com/krishnaiitd/swirl_courses.git (push)
	upstream	git@github.com:swirldev/swirl_courses.git (fetch)
	upstream	git@github.com:swirldev/swirl_courses.git (push)
	</code>
	</p>

	<p> If not then please add the remote i.e main repo as in <b>upstream</b> source. </p>

     <code>$ git remote add upstream 'git@github.com:swirldev/swirl_courses.git' </code>

     And then check it again as <code> git remote -v </code> you will get it.

     <p> Now the problem here is add the bob branch in you local systeam, so that you can work on that branch i.e bug-1 of bob.  It is simple, just add another upstream as <b> bob-upstream </b> in your remote </p>
     <code>$ git remote add bob-upstream 'git@github.com:bobusername/swirl_courses.git' </code>
     <p> After add this you can verify by above command <code>$ git remote -v </code> bob remote are visible. Now fetch the bobs branch as <code>$ git fetch bob-upstream </code> this commands will fetch the bobs all branch, now you can pull the bob's specific branch i.e bug-1 as <code>$ git fetch bug-1</code> or <code>$ git fetch bob-upstream/bug-1</code>
     </p>

     <p> Do what ever you want and then push to bob that branch as </p>
     <code>$ git push bob-upstream bug-1 </code>


     <h3> Read carfully above for the command <code> git remote add </code> to work with multiple fork branches. </h3>
