    <h2> Git branch (<code> git branch </code>) Command</h2>
  </p>
  <p>Git Branch is a command which helps in creating, deleting and listing branches of the main code.
    It is part of regular development process which helps in adding new features in a new branch to reverify your changes such that unstable code does not get merged with the master branch.
  </p>
  <p><code>git branch</code> helps in simultaneous development of multiple features in parallel branches and retains the stable code in the master branch</p>
  <p><code>git branch</code> acts as a pointer to a series of commits and has independent development line. it gives the project a fork like structure as new commits are saved in the current branch</p>
  <p>Another feature of it is that it does not let one switch between the branches.</p>
